# Horiseon-code-refactor
This project involved a refactor of the Horiseon webpage codebase so that it follows accesibility standards and is optimised for search engines.
The code now contains semantic html elements that follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
The content and appearance of the site remains the same
The application has been checked to ensure proper functioning of links.
The CSS selectors and properties have been consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.

The live application can be viewed here: https://lallender.github.io/Horiseon-code-refactor/

The following screenshots show the appearance of the application when launched:
